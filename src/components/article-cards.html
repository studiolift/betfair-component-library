  <h4><a href="">Aintree Saturday 14:45 - Back Frero Banbou</a></h4>
  <p>We may as well start with the Grand Sefton at 14:45, and at least we know they won't switch to the Mildmay course (that's what I have been told anyway) - that really would annoy ante-post punters of horses proven over the National fences - and it will be run in bottomless ground.</p>
  <p>He opened up at <span class="inline_odds" title="3.00"><span class="inline_odds__main">2/1</span><span class="inline_odds__tooltip">3.00</span></span> early on Thursday, and I feared that would not last until this copy went live. Then the 9s became 6s just after 2pm, so I had no option but to pull the bet. He is much bigger everywhere else, and as big as 10s in some places.</p>
